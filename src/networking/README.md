To see the prototype in action:
1. make build
2. make run.

The output on the console is actually a little messy, this is because output from 9 different client instances are seen on a single console,and the outputs kind of get in each others way.

The best way to run the test would be to run the server, and the 10 client executable in separate shell windows and see how those interact with each other.
